A Python implementation of the 3M Standard Interchange Protocol
(SIP). It's a client, but I've tried to be agnostic when defining the
protocol itself.

My goals are to implement enough of SIP to enable our e-reserve system
to interact with an ILS.

Many thanks to Georgia Public Library Service and to David Fiander for
the openncip project, which has been an invaluable source of insight.
