The install instructions in the README are the most up to date. These are
in the 'Syrup/conifer' directory if you use git to get the application.

  git clone git://git.evergreen-ils.org/Syrup.git

This document assumes you have Syrup running and walks through configuring a 
working instance.

.Why Syrup?
**********************************************************************
It is a little unclear. It might have been an acronym for 'Serving Your
Reserves to University Populations'. The project originated within 
http://projectconifer.ca/[Project Conifer] and pays homage to the library
world's most ambitious open source undertaking (otherwise known as
http://www.open-ils.org/[Evergreen]).

Initial Configuration
---------------------
Syrup needs time periods for controlling when course sites are to be made
available. After you log in the first time, the first stopping point should
probably be the 'Admin' link.

We use 'Terms' to define the period for which course materials will be 'active'.

You can define as many terms as you want but you need at least one to add
materials to Syrup. In this case, we will define one for the summer.

You also need at least one 'Service Desk' if you intend to offer physical
materials for reserves.

A service desk in Syrup is really just a helpful cue to the user where to
request materials. The name does not have to match the wording in your ILS
or elsewhere. The service desk can also be given a URL-friendly name for 
linking.
