Just a quick note on the directory structure here. 

views/__init__.py is the equivalent of 'views.py' from Django's
perspective.

__init__.py loads each of the submodules, which represent the various
components of the user interface.

_common.py is a common set of functions which are used by many of the
other modules. When in doubt, put your imports in _common.py.
