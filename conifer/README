State of the application
------------------------------

Coming along nicely, thank you! With a bit of patience, you ought to
be able to get a basic Syrup system running in no time. Integrating it
with your backend library and other systems will take longer, of
course.

Required components
------------------------------

You need Python. You also need sqlite3 or another Django-compatible
database. Sqlite3 is recommended for kicking the tires, PostgreSQL for
production.

Third-party Python dependencies:

  sudo easy_install Django Genshi Babel BabelDjango South Pyz3950 lxml ply

(You'll need 'setuptools' in order to have 'easy_install'.)

Windows is very similar, see:

http://groups.google.com/group/syrup-reserves-discuss/web/installing-syrup-in-windows

Getting this thing to run
------------------------------

This might work:

* Copy local_settings.py.example to local_settings.py, and review the settings

* If you want to use Evergreen authentication and/or plan to update the catalogue
from syrup, you must fill in all the commented values in local_settings and
set EVERGREEN_AUTHENTICATION to True

* ./manage.py syncdb

Note: don't use the "./" syntax in windows for the commands, e.g.:

C:\src\syrup\trunk\conifer>manage.py syncdb

* During syncdb, create yourself a superuser account.

* ./manage.py migrate

* ./pybabel-extract  (currently, this is optional, used for internationalization)

* ./manage.py runserver

* visit http://localhost:8000/ and log in.

* create at least one Term and one Department under Admin Options.

* make yourself a course.

* click on all of the links and see what they do.

If you have been following along
------------------------------

If you have an existing database, use south to deal with fields that have been added:

./manage.py schemamigration --auto conifer.syrup
./manage.py migrate conifer.syrup
