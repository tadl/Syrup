State of the application
------------------------------

Coming along nicely, thank you! With a bit of patience, you ought to
be able to get a basic Syrup system running in no time. Integrating it
with your backend library and other systems will take longer, of
course.

Required components
------------------------------

Most likely you will need a Unix-like system: Linux, BSD, or OS X
ought all to work. Most development and testing is being done on
Linux. No testing on Windows has been done.

You need Python. Probably Python 2.5, I haven't tested with other
versions. You also need sqlite3 or another Django-compatible
database. Sqlite3 is recommended for kicking the tires, PostgreSQL for
production.

Third-party Python dependencies:

  sudo easy_install Django Genshi Babel BabelDjango pexpect

(You'll need 'setuptools' in order to have 'easy_install'.)

Graham has the following versions installed. Not saying you need these
exact ones, just that they are known to work.

    Django-1.0.1_final-py2.5
    Babel-0.9.4-py2.5
    BabelDjango-0.2.2-py2.5
    Genshi-0.5.1-py2.5
    pexpect-2.4-py2.5

You will need 'yaz-client' for the Z39.50 stuff. On Ubuntu, this works:

    sudo apt-get install yaz libyaz3


Getting this thing to run
------------------------------

This might work:

* Review settings.py. Maybe you need to edit stuff. Probably not for a
  quick test.

* ./manage.py syncdb

* During syncdb, create yourself a superuser account.

* ./pybabel-extract  (currently, this is optional)

* ./manage.py runserver

* visit http://localhost:8000/ and log in.

* create at least one Term and one Department under Admin Options.

* make yourself a course.

* click on all of the links and see what they do.

The rest is straightforward Django stuff.


Customization
------------------------------

The 'custom' directory contains (or should contain!)  all of the bits
that you really need to customize for your institution. More
documentation is needed here, but the source code is mostly
well-documented.
