CRITICAL:

IMPORTANT:

* finish the physical-item received workflow.
  * how to model 'received' in the database?

* if someone has item checked out, show due date/time on item-about page.

* does 'move to new heading' show up in the right places? Should be like 'edit'.

* a short-number for physical items. Sort of a barcode, but intended
  for easier communicatinon between patrons and staff.
  (Update views.search() when this is in place)

* Import of reserves data from Leddy voyager. Laurentian, others?

* People should be able to register themselves into open courses.
  That is, actually become a member of them.

* accented characters in z3950 queries seem to fail. More tests needed.

* need more than 10 results on physical-item search results.

MAYBE:

* Generating barcodes in emails, printable screens? (3 of 9 enough?)

* add a hook for a MARC-record-to-maybe-cover-image-URL function
