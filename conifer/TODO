CRITICAL:

IMPORTANT:

* a short-number for physical items. Sort of a barcode, but intended
  for easier communicatinon between patrons and staff.
  (Update views.search() when this is in place)

* Import of reserves data from Leddy voyager. Laurentian, others?

* People should be able to register themselves into open courses.
  That is, actually become a member of them.

* delete Item / delete Heading

* testing on broken browsers (you know who you are)

* the code is littered with 'dwarf' refrences. Factor out into config.

* allow for bulk-import on add-physical-item

MAYBE:

* Generating barcodes in emails, printable screens? (3 of 9 enough?)

* add a hook for a MARC-record-to-maybe-cover-image-URL function
