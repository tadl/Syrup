CRITICAL:

IMPORTANT:

* "create course site" (not "add course")

* save-sequence fails on IE6.

* set up a proper issue-tracker?

* need more than 10 results on physical-item search results.

* if someone has item checked out, show due date/time on item-about page.

* People should be able to register themselves into open courses.
  That is, actually become a member of them.

* Import of reserves data from Leddy voyager. Laurentian, others?

* accented characters in z3950 queries seem to fail. More tests needed.

* manage z3950 targets? Search z3950 targets?

* Send me email when my sites change?

MAYBE:

* Generating barcodes in emails, printable screens? (3 of 9 enough?)

* add a hook for a MARC-record-to-maybe-cover-image-URL function


FROM KGS:

> Functions need "cancel" or "go back"

> Course details -- seems a little terse -- but may be what folks use

> Sequencing -- easy! Save -- maybe make a  button?  [where's my narrative?]

> Notify circulation of wanted items -- FAIL

> Why is staff a member of a course? is that a requirement? (proxy
> instructor makes more sense).

> Okay, I'll add a TODO for an alternate add-physical-item form, with
> a suitably-intimidating warning to encourage catalogue-use wherever
> possible.

RECENTLY DONE:

> As prof, can't view Renaissance, 2009W -- why is it listed if I
> can't view it? Can it be marked off in some way to indicate I don't
> have access?

> "Browse the Reserves (Note: some course materials may require you to
> log in)" -- (But I *am* logged in!)

> Add term: what's the format for adding a date? Can it prompt or have
> fielded entry? (just added Y-M-D label for now.)
