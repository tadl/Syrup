NEW:

* get rid of RESERVES_DESK_NAME from integration/local_settings.

* Syrup used to work with no integration module. Does it still?

* finish i18n and french translation.

* fix evergreen authentication problem ('django.py')

* break out evergreen_site and uwindsor. Take uwindsor out of svn?

* add a DOES_UPDATES flag: if true, then use oils/osrf, if not, use old code

* replace service desks with locations; pull locations from evergreen; add boolean field for locs that are service desks.


* from Joan: notify staff if entering an item (url or upload) that's been entered before. If so, "use the same record"

* for Joan: upload document into multiple sites at once?

* copy/paste items between sites

* make our uwindsor/evergreen integration module use the aforementioned locations list.

* for updated items: change it to the reserves location when coming in; change back to original location when done.


* review item_metadata.xhtml, fix those buttons, they have a superfluous link around them..

* add Welcome message to home page, use request@uwindsor.ca as the contact email for problems.

* check apache error logs for 'parse' error that Art mentioned.

* auto-centered column doesn't center in IE

* Sakai linkup -- test, seems not to work on SHOWCASE

* move item-status caching into the database: the new due-date checks are a
  bit slow, and the cache isn't shared across Apache instances.

* work on circ modifier stuff (art and dan's conversation)

* bookbag-URL search should import all items from the bookbag (if they don't already exist)
  -- actually, I'm not 100% certain about this, esp if we implement "Sakai linkup" below.

* search should include course number (fragments too, not just full course codes)

* catalogue search should autodetect call numbers, as well as copy barcodes.

* download declaration only needed for "fair dealing". This may be uwindsor specific.

* optional, persistent link between a course site and a bookbag URL, as an interim step for windsor.

* how should "join this site" be managed?

* write up some documentation

* why are .focus() calls not working properly?

* hit counts for item accesses?

* unapi on single-item pages

CRITICAL:

IMPORTANT:

MAYBE:

* refactor the add/edit item code in items.py

* refactor fuzzyFinder into a Genshi component.

* set up a proper issue-tracker?

* if someone has item checked out, show due date/time on item-about page.

* Send me email when my sites change?

* Import of reserves data from Leddy voyager. Laurentian, others?

* manage z3950 targets? Search z3950 targets?

* title-details links in circ-needs, that needs to be made non EG specific.

FROM KGS:

> Functions need "cancel" or "go back"

> Course details -- seems a little terse -- but may be what folks use
 
> Why is staff a member of a course? is that a requirement? (proxy
> instructor makes more sense; but how to accomplish that?).

> an alternate add-physical-item form, with a suitably-intimidating
> warning to encourage catalogue-use wherever possible.


RECENTLY DONE:

> As prof, can't view Renaissance, 2009W -- why is it listed if I
> can't view it? Can it be marked off in some way to indicate I don't
> have access?

> "Browse the Reserves (Note: some course materials may require you to
> log in)" -- (But I *am* logged in!)

> Add term: what's the format for adding a date? Can it prompt or have
> fielded entry? (just added Y-M-D label for now.)

* "create course site" (not "add course")

* save-sequence fails on IE6.

* People should be able to register themselves into open courses.
  That is, actually become a member of them.

> Sequencing -- easy! Save -- maybe make a  button?  [where's my narrative?]
  [I didn't make it a button, but I did add the narrative back.]

* Z39.50 may return e-journal records (with 856u hyperlinks) and other
  non-physical items. 856$9 is a definitive indicator in the Conifer
  (Evergreen?) context.

* factor out hardcoded references to the EG server.

* add new staff member

* add URL form should have same metadata as ELEC form (except for copyright status)

* edit URL item fails with error. KeyError: author2

* add Joan's new text

* hide 'Create a new Reserves Site' from 'My Reserves'

* review CLEW integration. KISS.

* repair unAPI -- it seems broken on SHOWCASE (it was just not working for non-physical items)

* make sure volume, issue, source title, etc. are exposed over unAPI.

* make "DVD" and other media types obvious (icons, explicit descriptions, etc.)

* show call number on index pages

* index pages when printed, should show call all numbers clearly

* add/remove individuals in course sites

* review placement of Available buttons, they move around

* uwindsor only: import data from ERes and bookbags into Syrup.

* permissions: clicking "add group" should pull the whole form into focus.
