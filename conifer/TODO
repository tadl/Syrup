CRITICAL:

IMPORTANT:

* does 'move to new heading' show up in the right places? Should be like 'edit'.

* CSS fixes for Internet Explorer. It looks crappy in IE.

* if someone has item checked out, show due date/time on item-about page.

* need more than 10 results on physical-item search results.

* People should be able to register themselves into open courses.
  That is, actually become a member of them.

* Import of reserves data from Leddy voyager. Laurentian, others?

* accented characters in z3950 queries seem to fail. More tests needed.

* manage z3950 targets? Search z3950 targets?

* Send me email when my sites change?

MAYBE:

* Generating barcodes in emails, printable screens? (3 of 9 enough?)

* add a hook for a MARC-record-to-maybe-cover-image-URL function
