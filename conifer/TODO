CRITICAL:

IMPORTANT:

* allow concat.ca, windsor.concat.ca, etc. for paste-in item queries.

* for Windsor, write temporary web-services for directory services.

* Notify circulation of wanted items. What should it do?

* set up a proper issue-tracker?

* opensrf alternatives for SIP calls?

* need more than 10 results on physical-item search results.

* if someone has item checked out, show due date/time on item-about page.

* Send me email when my sites change?

* Import of reserves data from Leddy voyager. Laurentian, others?

* accented characters in z3950 queries seem to fail. More tests needed.

* manage z3950 targets? Search z3950 targets?

* title-details links in circ-needs, that needs to be made non EG specific.
MAYBE:

* Generating barcodes in emails, printable screens? (3 of 9 enough?)

* add a hook for a MARC-record-to-maybe-cover-image-URL function


FROM KGS:

> Functions need "cancel" or "go back"

> Course details -- seems a little terse -- but may be what folks use

> Notify circulation of wanted items -- FAIL
 
> Why is staff a member of a course? is that a requirement? (proxy
> instructor makes more sense; but how to accomplish that?).

> an alternate add-physical-item form, with a suitably-intimidating
> warning to encourage catalogue-use wherever possible.


RECENTLY DONE:

> As prof, can't view Renaissance, 2009W -- why is it listed if I
> can't view it? Can it be marked off in some way to indicate I don't
> have access?

> "Browse the Reserves (Note: some course materials may require you to
> log in)" -- (But I *am* logged in!)

> Add term: what's the format for adding a date? Can it prompt or have
> fielded entry? (just added Y-M-D label for now.)

* "create course site" (not "add course")

* save-sequence fails on IE6.

* People should be able to register themselves into open courses.
  That is, actually become a member of them.

> Sequencing -- easy! Save -- maybe make a  button?  [where's my narrative?]
  [I didn't make it a button, but I did add the narrative back.]

* Z39.50 may return e-journal records (with 856u hyperlinks) and other
  non-physical items. 856$9 is a definitive indicator in the Conifer
  (Evergreen?) context.

* factor out hardcoded references to the EG server.
