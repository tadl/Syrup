Copy the text, filtering out any lines that don't match "\d\d-\d\d\d"
Save the result to file "list-as-text".

Using twill-sh:
	  go http://web4.uwindsor.ca/units/leddy/leddy.nsf/CourseReserves!OpenForm
	  showlinks
Save "showlinks" result, and keep every line that matches "^[0-9]+\. [0-9]+". 
Some of the course-numbers have spaces in them, or characters other
	 than spaces following them. These need to be fixed by hand.
Particularly, search for \240 characters, and replace them with space (" ").
Save the result to "urllist".
